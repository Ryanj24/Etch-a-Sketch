# Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch project for the Odin Project.
This aim of this project was to create a canvas within which the user could create a sketch of some form where when holding down the mouse and moving the cursor across the canvas, it would create a pixelated trail. The project was completed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript where DOM manipulation and the use of event listeners were crucial to ensuring the project worked as intended.
